## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
<p>
  This project is a point of sales system that allows users to manage sales and inventory, and print receipts. The system is built using Java Swing for the GUI and MySQL for the database.
</p>


## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
<p>
  To get started with the project, you will need to clone the repository and set up the database.
</p>

### Prerequisites

  - Java JDK 8 or later
  - MySQL
  
If you don't already have Java JDK installed, you can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

To install MySQL, you can download the installer from the [MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Once you have Java JDK and MySQL installed, you will also need to create a database for the point-of-sales system. You can do this using the MySQL command line or a GUI tool such as [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/).


### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.
Say what the step will be
```
Follow these steps to get the development environment up and running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/point-of-sales-system.git

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.

3. Open the src/main/java/com/example/pos/config/DatabaseConfig.java file and modify the database connection settings as needed.

4. Build the project by running the mvn clean install command in the project directory.

5. After building the project, locate the target/point-of-sales-system.jar file and run it using the following command:
java -jar point-of-sales-system.jar

6. The point-of-sales system should now be running. You should see the login screen where you can log in using the default administrator credentials:

- Username: admin
- Password: password123

That's it! You should now be able to use the point-of-sales system. If you encounter any issues during installation or setup, 
feel free to refer to the troubleshooting section or open an issue on GitHub.
```

## Demo
```
To get started with the point-of-sales system, try adding a new product to the inventory.

1. Log in to the system using the administrator credentials.
2. Click on the "Inventory" tab in the navigation bar.
3. Click on the "Add Product" button and fill in the details for the new product.
4. Click "Save" to add the product to the inventory.
5. You should now be able to see the new product in the inventory list.

Congratulations, you have successfully added a new product to the point-of-sales system! 
You can continue exploring the system and its features by adding more products, creating new orders, and generating reports.
